   Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
      </p>

      <p>
It is used for:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
        </li>
        <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
</li>
        <li>
          Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.

          </li>
          <li>
            Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

          <li>
            The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
          </li>
          <li>In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.

        <ul>
          <li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
</li>

          <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
</li>


          <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
</li>

    <p>
      As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
    </p>
  <code>>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
      </code>
<p>Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line</p>

<code>C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
</code>

      <p>
        Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
</p>
<p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

      <h1>Variables</h1>
      <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
      <h1>Creating Variables</h1>
      <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable.A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
      <code>x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)</code>
<p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set</p>
<code>x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
    <header>Global variables</header>
    <article>
      <p>
       Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
      </p>
      <p>Create a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the function

</p>
<code>x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()</code>
<p>If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.</p>

<p>Create a variable inside a function, with the same name as the global variable

</p>
<code>x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)</code>

    <article>
      <p>
        There are three numeric types in Python:
      </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>int</li>

<li>float</li>

<li>complex</strong></li>
</ul>
    <p>Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:</p>
    <code>x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex</code>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Python_Strings">
    <header>Python Strings</header>
    <article>
      <p>Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

<strong>'hello'</strong> is the same as <strong>"hello"</strong>.

You can display a string literal with the print() function:</p>

<code>print("Hello")
print('Hello')</code>
<h1>Assign String to a Variable</h1>
<p>Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:</p>
<code>a = "Hello"
print(a)</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Python_Booleans">
    <header>Python Booleans</header>
    <article>
   <p>Booleans represent one of two values: <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>.
<h1>Boolean Values</h1>
<p>In programming you often need to know if an expression is <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>.You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>.When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:</p>
<code>print(10 > 9)
print(10 == 9)
print(10 < 9)</code>

<p>When you run a condition in an if statement, Python returns <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>:</p>
<p>Print a message based on whether the condition is True or False:</p>
<code>a = 200
b = 33

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Python_Tuples">
    <header>Python Tuples</header>
    <article>
     <p>Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.<br>Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.A tuple is a collection which is ordered and <Strong>unchangeable</strong>.<br>Tuples are written with round brackets.</p>
     <code>thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)</code>
<h1>Tuple Items</h1>
<p>Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.</p>
<h1>Ordered</h1>
When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
<h1>Unchangeable</h1>
Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
<h1>Allow Duplicates</h1>
Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:
<code>thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
print(thistuple)</code>
    </article>

  <section class="main-section" id="Python_Sets">
    <header>Python Sets</header>
    <article>
    <p><h1>Set</h1>
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.</p>
<p>Sets are written with curly brackets.</p>
<code>thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)</code>




<h1>Set Items</h1>
Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.

<h1>Unordered</h1>
Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.

Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.

<h1>Unchangeable</h1>
Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.

Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.

<h1>Duplicates Not Allowed</h1>
Sets cannot have two items with the same value.
Duplicate values will be ignored:
<code>thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}

print(thisset)</code>
